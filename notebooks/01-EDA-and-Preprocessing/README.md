# Assignment 01: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing
### Objective
This project covers the essential first steps of any data science workflow. The goal is to take a raw housing dataset, understand its structure, clean it, handle categorical data, and prepare it for future machine learning tasks through visualization and feature scaling.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
**Data Loading & Inspection:** Using pandas to load a CSV file and inspect its basic properties (.head(), .info(), .shape).

**Data Cleaning:** Identifying and handling different data types.

**Feature Transformation:** Manually converting categorical text features (like 'yes'/'no') into numerical format (1/0) that a model can understand.

**Data Visualization:** Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create scatter plots and histograms to explore relationships and distributions within the data.

**Feature Scaling:** Applying Min-Max scaling to normalize all features into a common range, a crucial step for many machine learning algorithms.

### Dataset
The project uses the Housing Prices Dataset, which contains various features describing residential homes in an Indian city.
